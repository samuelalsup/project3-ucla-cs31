# project3-ucla-cs31
I did not write the grid.cpp or grid.h files.
I wrote the entirety of the plot.cpp file to make the program run correctly. 
It is able to draw characters on a grid using a series of commands. 
Some commands are: h12 or h-3 to make it go horizontally to the right 12 spaces or horizontally to the left 3 spaces
v5 or v-16 to make it go up 5 spaces or down 16 spaces
f@ to change the plotting character to the @ character and to override any other characters in a position (f means foreground plotting)
b& to change the plotting character to the & character and to only plot the character if the one at that position is a space (b means background plotting)
